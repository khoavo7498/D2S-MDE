# D2S-MDE: Dual Camera Relocalization and Monocular Depth Fusion for Digital Twin–Based 3D Safety Monitoring in Construction.
In this study, we propose a vision-based framework to enhance construction safety monitoring by fusing camera relocalization and monocular depth estimation within a unified pipeline, integrated with digital twin technology. Our target is presenting a system that predict and monitoring the operation of tower crane in crowded enviroments
